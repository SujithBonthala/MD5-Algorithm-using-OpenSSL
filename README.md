# MD5-Algorithm-using-OpenSSL

#### A file-authentication system that uses MD-5 algorithm to hash a file and store the generated hash in a database. The file can then moved into a cloud interface. After a certain period of time, when the file is downloaded from the cloud, it can be authenticated by generating its hash again and comparing it with the hash already present in the database.

#### The user can perform two actions. One of them is to create the MD-5 hash of a file and store it in the database. The other is validation of downloaded file to the pre-existing hashes in the database.
